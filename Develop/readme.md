# Porfolio Project

  ### This a Random Password Generator project where I used the confirm method, prompt function, an array with objects, and conditional statements to generate a random password.  I also left my mistakes commented out so that I can refer back later.

  ## Code used: HTLM, CSS, and Javascript.

  ## Using the confirm method:

   * captured user input as a true or false statement when the user cklicked "ok" or "cancel"
   * used the true or false statements in conditons and ran them through a "for" loop

  ## Using Prompt Function 

   * captured user input as numbers when they chose the length of their password
   * used the user inupt password length to run through a "for" loop to determine length of password
  

  ## Conditional Statements

   * used conditional statements to generate the password and to alert user if certain criteria was not met when choosing a password

  ## Array with Objects

   * used an array with ojects to pull information from the array based off of what the user chose during the confirm prompts

  ## CSS

  * fixed resizing issue using media query and flex
